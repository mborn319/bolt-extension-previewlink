Bolt Preview Link
==================

The Bolt Preview Link extension is an extension to help you share unpublished content with other people that are not logged in to Bolt. 
For instance, when you want an doublecheck an article with an external editor for proofreading purposes.

What the extension does:
- When content is _unpublished_ or in _draft_, it displays a previewlink in the sidebar
- Generates a link for viewing the content without logging into Bolt
- You can copy the previewlink to your clipboard
- You can also open a new tab by clicking on the preview button

No configuration is needed.
